
                   PICK SUPPORTED COMPONENTS FOR R83


 BIOS:          Phoenix, Award and AMI (American Megatrend Inc)


 HARD DISK:     MFM, RLL, ESDI, SCSI, and IDE


                INT13 is utilized for all hard disk operations and
                therefore can support these drives without having native
                drivers.  Many hard disk controllers replace the
                computer's BIOS INT13 support with built-in BIOS INT13 
                support.  PICK can use these controllers to access RLL,
                ESDI, SCSI, IDE, and other types of drives.
 
                Some controllers and drives may support fewer cylinders,
                sectors and heads than the PICK BIOS INT13 Interface.
                The values are then limited by the PICK BIOS INT13
                Interface.

                Hard disk support is limited by the hard disk
                controller, by the hard disk, by the PICK BIOS INT13
                Interface, and by the computer's or any built-in BIOS
                INT13 Interface.  The PICK BIOS INT13 Interface is
                defined as:

                The max. number of cylinders is 1024 (0-1023) 10 bits
                are used for the number of cylinders
                The max. number of sectors is 64 (0-63) 6 bits are used
                for the number of sectors
                The max. number of heads is 64 (0-63) 4 bits are used
                for the number of heads
                The max. number of drives is 2 (0-1) 1 bit is used for
                the drive number

             NOTE: This will give maximum disk storage of 2Gb
                (1024x64x64x512) per drive, assuming INT13 supports
                logical sector, head and cylinder.

                If your disk drive exceeds these limits, you must have a
                disk controller that subsititutes its own INT13 drivers
                and transparently makes access to the drive conform to
                these limits.


 SERIAL CARDS:  PICK must have an installed driver for each serial card
                it supports.  Most of the drivers for the cards listed
                are internal to PICK, yet a few have their own external
                drivers.  See Installation Guide, for all Serial Card
                settings.

 1/4" TAPE:     Quarter inch streaming cartridge tape drives need
                 device drivers already installed with PICK.   The 1/4"
                 tape controller must be set to IRQ5 (INTx'D').  Port
                 address must be x'338', x'310, x'312'.
